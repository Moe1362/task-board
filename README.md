# Task Board Starter Code

Task-Board :

The motivation behind this project is categorizing tasks based on priority. This project reminds the user of tasks with higher priorities to be done, and once a task is completed, it moves to the completed section. Working on this project helped me learn jQuery and jQuery UI.


## Installation

The first step is to clone the project from GitHub, then paste it in the desired folder using the terminal or Git Bash, open it in the editor, and have access to the code.
